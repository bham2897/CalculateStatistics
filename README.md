Median: The middle value in the dataset.
Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.
Standard Deviation: A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in the dataset.
Kurtosis: A measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.
Skewness: A measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of the dataset.
Minimum: The smallest value in the dataset.
Maximum: The largest value in the dataset.
Sum: The total sum of all values in the dataset.
Count: The number of values in the dataset.
Usage
Input: The script takes an array of numerical values as input.
